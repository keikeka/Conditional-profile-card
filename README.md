# Conditional Profile Card

> By Keili Rosales

## Objective

Create a dynamic HTML + CSS using Javascript algorithms to represent a profile card.
A `render` function is applied that changes its execution, based on a series of variables (assigned through string interpolation) as well as the user behavior if he selects different options or modifies any input.
The HTML outputs are modified by adding their corresponding variables and in some cases it is checked with ternary operations that their parameters are given by default.

## Application

1. Install the NPM packages (be sure to use the latest version of node): `npm install`.
2. Run the project using: `npm run start`.
Verify that the `render` function reacts to the card changes.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Conditionals and Conditional Rendering
